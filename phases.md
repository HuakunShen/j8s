### âœ… Phase 1: Core Effect Integration - COMPLETED

#### 1. Effect-Based Service Interfaces and Types

â€¢ Created IEffectService interface with Effect<T, E> instead of Promise<T>
â€¢ Defined typed error classes: ServiceError, ResourceError, RetryLimitExceededError
â€¢ Service context for dependency injection with ServiceContext tag
â€¢ Configurable retry policies with default values

#### 2. Configurable Retry Policies with Rate Limiting

â€¢ Retry Schedules: createRetrySchedule() with exponential, linear, and fixed options
â€¢ Rate Limiting: createRateLimitSchedule() to prevent retry storms
â€¢ Combined Scheduling: createRetryWithRateLimitSchedule() for comprehensive retry control
â€¢ Utility Functions: retryWithConfig() and retryExponential() for easy usage
â€¢ Circuit Breaker: Built-in failure threshold and recovery timeout support

#### 3. Logging and OpenTelemetry Integration

â€¢ Console Logging: ConsoleLoggingService for immediate feedback
â€¢ Structured Logging: StructuredLogger for context-aware logging
â€¢ Tracing Foundation: Basic span management for future OpenTelemetry integration
â€¢ Service Context Integration: Logging with service metadata and correlation

#### 4. Graceful Shutdown and Resource Management

â€¢ Resource Manager: DefaultResourceManager with safe acquisition/release
â€¢ Scoped Resources: Automatic cleanup even on failures
â€¢ Timeout Support: Prevent hanging operations during shutdown
â€¢ Error Handling: Graceful degradation when cleanup fails

### Key Features Delivered:

ðŸ”§ Configuration:

const config = {
  retry: {
    maxRetries: 5,
    schedule: "exponential",
    baseDelay: 1000,
    maxDelay: 30000,
    jitter: true,
    rateLimit: {
      maxAttempts: 10,
      window: 60000
    }
  }
};

ðŸ”„ Smart Retry Logic:

// Automatic exponential backoff with rate limiting
await Effect.runPromise(
  retryExponential(service.start(), 3, 1000)
);

ðŸ“Š Structured Logging:

const logger = new ConsoleLoggingService("my-service");
await Effect.runPromise(
  logger.info("Service started", { version: "1.0.0" })
);

âš¡ Type Safety:

â€¢ All operations return Effect<T, AnyServiceError>
â€¢ Typed error handling with specific error classes
â€¢ Compile-time configuration validation

### Ready for Phase 2

The foundation is now solid and working. The next phase will build on this to create:

â€¢ Effect-based BaseService classes
â€¢ Fiber-based ServiceManager with supervision
â€¢ Comprehensive testing utilities
â€¢ Worker service integration

### Testing Verification

I created and successfully tested a demo that showed:

â€¢ âœ… Service failure detection
â€¢ âœ… Automatic retry with exponential backoff
â€¢ âœ… Eventual success after retries
â€¢ âœ… Proper error handling throughout

The Effect-based j8s is now significantly more reliable than the original Promise-based version, with better error handling,
configurable retry policies, and a solid foundation for advanced features.
