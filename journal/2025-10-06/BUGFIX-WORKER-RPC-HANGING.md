# Bug Fix: Worker Service RPC Hanging with Effect Scheduling

## Executive Summary

After migrating j8s to use the Effect library for scheduling, WorkerService-based scheduled jobs stopped working. Services would execute once but then hang indefinitely, preventing scheduled repetition. The root cause was using Node.js `worker_threads` API instead of the web Worker API that kkrpc expects.

**Impact**: All scheduled cron jobs using WorkerService were non-functional.

**Fix Duration**: ~3 hours of investigation

## Symptom Description

### What the User Observed

```typescript
// User's code in apps/services/src/run.ts
serviceManager.addService(incomeHistoryService, {
  restartPolicy: "always",
  scheduledJob: {
    schedule: Schedule.cron("*/20 * * * * *"), // Every 20 seconds
    timeout: Duration.millis(120000),
  },
})
```

**Expected Behavior**: Service should run every 20 seconds indefinitely.

**Actual Behavior**:
1. ✅ Service runs successfully the first time
2. ❌ After completion, timeout exception fires even though service already completed:
   ```
   [00:05:50.73] INFO: Income History service stopped
   Service 'income-history-snapshot' failed in scheduled job: 
   TimeoutException: Operation timed out after '2m'
   ```
3. ❌ No subsequent runs occur - service never repeats

### Log Evidence

```
[00:05:49.51] [INFO]: Income History service started
[00:05:49.52] [INFO]: Income history snapshot completed
[00:05:50.12] [INFO]: All income history processing completed
[00:05:51.12] [INFO]: Income History service stopped

Service 'income-history-snapshot' failed in scheduled job: TimeoutException
```

**Key Observation**: Service completes in ~2 seconds, but timeout fires at exactly 2 minutes later.

---

## Initial Investigation

### Phase 1: Effect Timeout Investigation

**Initial Hypothesis**: `Effect.timeout` was not completing when the service finished.

**Investigation**:
- Analyzed how `Effect.timeout` was being used in ServiceManager
- Found it was waiting for the full timeout duration before checking completion

**First Fix Attempt**: Replace `Effect.timeout` with `Effect.race`
```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
const timedServiceEffect = timeout
  ? Effect.timeout(serviceEffect, timeout)
  : serviceEffect;

// After (BETTER but not the real fix)
const timedServiceEffect = timeout
  ? Effect.race(
      serviceEffect,
      Effect.sleep(timeout).pipe(
        Effect.andThen(Effect.fail(new Error(`Timeout`)))
      )
    )
  : serviceEffect;
```

**Result**: ❌ Services still didn't repeat after first run.

---

### Phase 2: Service Lifecycle Investigation

**Second Hypothesis**: Services calling `stop()` internally were preventing repetition.

**Investigation**:
```typescript
// Found in income-history-snapshot.ts
async start(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await this.takeSnapshot()
    await this.stop()  // ⚠️ Closes DB connections
  } catch (error) {
    await this.stop()  // ⚠️ Closes DB connections
    throw error
  }
}
```

**Second Fix Attempt**: Remove internal `stop()` calls
```typescript
async start(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await this.takeSnapshot()
    // DON'T call stop() here - ServiceManager handles lifecycle
  } catch (error) {
    throw error
  }
}
```

**Result**: ❌ Still hanging. Services complete but never repeat.

---

### Phase 3: IServiceAdapter State Investigation

**Third Hypothesis**: Adapter's `started` flag was preventing re-execution.

**Investigation**:
```typescript
// IServiceAdapter.ts
async start(): Promise<void> {
  if (this.started || this.startPromise) {
    return this.startPromise || Promise.resolve();  // Returns early!
  }
  // ... actual start logic
  this.started = true;
}
```

**Flow Analysis**:
1. First run: `started = false` → Runs successfully → `started = true`
2. Second run: `started = true` → Returns immediately without running!

**Third Fix Attempt**: Reset adapter state after each scheduled job
```typescript
// In ServiceManager.setupScheduledJob()
const result = yield* Effect.either(timedServiceEffect);

// Reset adapter state to allow next execution
yield* Effect.promise(() => managedService.adapter.stop());
```

**Result**: ❌ STILL hanging! But now we're getting closer...

---

### Phase 4: Race Condition Discovery

**Fourth Hypothesis**: Multiple start calls were racing.

**Investigation**:
Added detailed logging:
```
[ScheduledJob] Calling adapter.start()  ← From scheduled job fiber
...
[IServiceAdapter] start() called... started=false, hasPromise=false
[IServiceAdapter] Actually starting service
[IServiceAdapter] start() called... started=false, hasPromise=true  ← DUPLICATE!
[IServiceAdapter] Returning early (already started or starting)
```

**Analysis**: 
- Scheduled job fiber starts service automatically when `addService()` is called
- `startAllServicesEffect()` ALSO tries to start the service
- Two competing start mechanisms!

**Fourth Fix Attempt**: Skip manual start for scheduled services
```typescript
public startAllServicesEffect(): Effect.Effect<void, Error> {
  // Filter out services with scheduled jobs - they start automatically
  const manualStartServices = serviceNames.filter((name) => {
    const managed = this.managedServices.get(name);
    return !managed?.config.scheduledJob;
  });
  
  // Only start manual services
  yield* Effect.all(
    manualStartServices.map((name) => this.startServiceEffect(name))
  );
}
```

**Result**: ❌ Race condition fixed, but RPC still hangs!

---

### Phase 5: The Real Problem - RPC Hanging

**Key Discovery**: Even without Effect or ServiceManager, RPC hangs:

```typescript
// Direct test without Effect
const workerService = createWorkerService("test", url, { autoTerminate: false })
await workerService.start()  // ← HANGS FOREVER
```

**Log Evidence**:
```
[Worker] start() called
[Worker] start() returning
... (nothing more - promise never resolves)
```

Worker completes, but RPC promise never resolves!

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Smoking Gun

Created a minimal kkrpc test bypassing j8s entirely:

```typescript
// Direct kkrpc usage (WORKS!)
const worker = new Worker(url.href, { type: "module" })
const io = new WorkerParentIO(worker)
const rpc = new RPCChannel(io, {})
const api = rpc.getAPI()

await api.start()  // ✅ Works perfectly!
```

**Critical Observation**: kkrpc works fine when used directly, but fails through j8s's WorkerService.

### Comparing Implementations

**kkrpc Test (WORKING)**:
```typescript
// From kkrpc's own test suite
const worker = new Worker(url.href, { type: "module" })  // Global Worker
const io = new WorkerParentIO(worker)
```

**j8s WorkerService (BROKEN)**:
```typescript
// From packages/j8s/src/WorkerService.ts
import { Worker as NodeWorker } from "node:worker_threads";  // ⚠️ WRONG!

this.worker = new NodeWorker(url.toString(), workerOptions);
this.io = new WorkerParentIO(this.worker as any);  // Type cast hiding the problem
```

### The Bug

**j8s was using Node.js `worker_threads` API instead of the web Worker API!**

| Aspect | Node.js `worker_threads` | Web Worker API |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Import | `import { Worker } from "node:worker_threads"` | Global `Worker` |
| Event API | `.addListener("error", ...)` | `.addEventListener("error", ...)` |
| kkrpc Compatibility | ❌ Incompatible | ✅ Compatible |
| Available In | Node.js only | Bun, Deno, Browsers |

**Why It Broke After Effect Migration**:
The code always had this bug, but it wasn't caught because:
1. Previous version may have used different RPC handling
2. The bug manifested more clearly with Effect's promise handling
3. Bun's web Worker API is the standard, not Node's worker_threads

---

## The Fix

### 1. WorkerService API Change

**File**: `packages/j8s/src/WorkerService.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - Node.js worker_threads)
import { Worker as NodeWorker } from "node:worker_threads";
import type { WorkerOptions } from "node:worker_threads";

export class WorkerService extends BaseService {
  private worker: NodeWorker | null = null;
  
  private initWorker(): void {
    const workerOptions: WorkerOptions = { /* ... */ };
    this.worker = new NodeWorker(this.options.workerURL.toString(), workerOptions);
    
    // Node.js event API
    this.worker.addListener("error", (event) => { /* ... */ });
    this.worker.addListener("messageerror", (event) => { /* ... */ });
  }
}
```

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT - Web Worker API)
// Use the global Worker API (web workers) instead of node:worker_threads
// kkrpc expects the web Worker API which is available in Bun/Deno/browsers
type WorkerType = Worker;

export class WorkerService extends BaseService {
  private worker: WorkerType | null = null;
  
  private initWorker(): void {
    const workerOptions: any = {
      type: "module",
      ...(this.options.workerOptions || {}),
      ...(this.options.workerData !== undefined
        ? { workerData: this.options.workerData }
        : {}),
    };

    // Use URL.href like kkrpc tests do
    const workerPath = typeof this.options.workerURL === 'string' 
      ? this.options.workerURL
      : this.options.workerURL.href;
    
    // Use global Worker API
    this.worker = new Worker(workerPath, workerOptions);
    
    // Web Worker event API
    this.worker.addEventListener("error", (event) => { /* ... */ });
    this.worker.addEventListener("messageerror", (event) => { /* ... */ });
  }
}
```

### 2. Service Lifecycle Management

**Files**: 
- `apps/services/src/services/income-history-snapshot.ts`
- `apps/services/src/services/wallet-balance-history.ts`
- `apps/services/src/services/orders-history-snapshot.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - closes connections after each run)
async start(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await this.takeSnapshot()
    await this.stop()  // ⚠️ Closes DB/Redis connections
  } catch (error) {
    await this.stop()
    throw error
  }
}
```

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT - let ServiceManager handle lifecycle)
async start(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await this.takeSnapshot()
    // DON'T call stop() here for scheduled jobs!
    // The ServiceManager will call stop() when the worker is shutting down.
    // Calling stop() here would close DB connections needed for the next run.
  } catch (error) {
    throw error
  }
}
```

### 3. Scheduled Job Start Logic

**File**: `packages/j8s/src/ServiceManager.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - tries to start scheduled services manually)
public startAllServicesEffect(): Effect.Effect<void, Error> {
  const serviceNames = Array.from(this.managedServices.keys());
  
  // Tries to start ALL services, including scheduled ones
  const results = yield* Effect.all(
    serviceNames.map((name) => this.startServiceEffect(name))
  );
}
```

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT - skip manual start for scheduled services)
public startAllServicesEffect(): Effect.Effect<void, Error> {
  const serviceNames = Array.from(this.managedServices.keys());
  
  // Filter out services with scheduled jobs - they start automatically
  const manualStartServices = serviceNames.filter((name) => {
    const managed = this.managedServices.get(name);
    return !managed?.config.scheduledJob;
  });
  
  const scheduledServices = serviceNames.filter((name) => {
    const managed = this.managedServices.get(name);
    return !!managed?.config.scheduledJob;
  });
  
  yield* Effect.logInfo(
    `Starting ${manualStartServices.length} manual services and ` +
    `${scheduledServices.length} scheduled services (auto-start)`
  );
  
  // Only start manual services
  const results = yield* Effect.all(
    manualStartServices.map((name) => this.startServiceEffect(name)),
    { concurrency: 'unbounded' }
  );
}
```

### 4. Effect Scheduling Pattern

**File**: `packages/j8s/src/ServiceManager.ts`

```typescript
// Use Effect.repeat for indefinite scheduled job repetition
const scheduledJobEffect = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const jobEffect = Effect.gen(function* () {
    managedService.status = "running";
    
    // Execute service
    const serviceEffect = Effect.tryPromise({
      try: () => managedService.adapter.start(),
      catch: (e) => (e instanceof Error ? e : new Error(String(e))),
    });
    
    // Apply timeout with Effect.race
    const timedServiceEffect = timeout
      ? Effect.race(
          serviceEffect,
          Effect.sleep(timeout).pipe(
            Effect.andThen(
              Effect.fail(new Error(`Service '${name}' timed out`))
            )
          )
        )
      : serviceEffect;
    
    const result = yield* Effect.either(timedServiceEffect);
    
    // CRITICAL: Reset adapter state after each run
    yield* Effect.promise(() => managedService.adapter.stop());
    
    if (result._tag === "Left") {
      managedService.status = "crashed";
      return;
    } else {
      managedService.status = "stopped";
      return;
    }
  });
  
  // Use Effect.repeat for indefinite repetition
  yield* jobEffect.pipe(
    Effect.repeat(schedule),
    Effect.catchAllCause((cause) => {
      console.error(`Scheduled job '${name}' encountered fatal error:`, cause);
      return Effect.void;
    })
  );
});

managedService.scheduledJobFiber = Effect.runFork(scheduledJobEffect);
```

### 5. Worker Configuration

**File**: `apps/services/src/run.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - autoTerminate kills worker immediately)
const incomeHistoryService = createWorkerService(
  "income-history-snapshot",
  incomeHistorySnapshotUrl,
  {
    autoTerminate: true,  // ⚠️ Terminates after first run
    workerData: { useJ8sWorker: true },
  }
)
```

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT - keep worker alive for repeated runs)
const incomeHistoryService = createWorkerService(
  "income-history-snapshot",
  incomeHistorySnapshotUrl,
  {
    autoTerminate: false,  // Keep worker alive for scheduled jobs
    workerData: { useJ8sWorker: true },
  }
)
```

---

## Debugging Procedure

### Step-by-Step Investigation Process

#### 1. Isolate the Scheduling System

**Goal**: Determine if the problem is with Effect scheduling or something else.

```bash
# Test with BaseService (no workers)
bun run test-base-service-cron.ts
```

**Result**: BaseService works perfectly → Problem is specific to WorkerService.

#### 2. Test Without Effect

**Goal**: Determine if Effect is causing the issue.

```typescript
// Create test-worker-no-effect.ts
const workerService = createWorkerService("test", url, { autoTerminate: false })
await workerService.start()  // Does this hang?
```

**Result**: Hangs even without Effect → Problem is in WorkerService itself.

#### 3. Test kkrpc Directly

**Goal**: Determine if kkrpc is broken or if j8s is using it wrong.

```typescript
// Create test-kkrpc-direct.ts - Use kkrpc exactly like their tests
const worker = new Worker(url.href, { type: "module" })
const io = new WorkerParentIO(worker)
const rpc = new RPCChannel(io, {})
const api = rpc.getAPI()
await api.start()
```

**Result**: kkrpc works perfectly → Problem is how j8s uses kkrpc.

#### 4. Compare Implementations

**Goal**: Find the difference between working and broken code.

```bash
# Read kkrpc's test file
cat packages/kkrpc/__tests__/bun.worker.test.ts

# Compare with j8s WorkerService
cat packages/j8s/src/WorkerService.ts
```

**Key Findings**:
| kkrpc Test | j8s WorkerService |
|------------|-------------------|
| `new Worker(url.href, {type: "module"})` | `new NodeWorker(url.toString(), options)` |
| Global `Worker` | `import { Worker } from "node:worker_threads"` |
| `.addEventListener()` | `.addListener()` |

**Root cause identified**: Wrong Worker API!

#### 5. Verify the Fix

```bash
# Test with web Worker API
bun run test-worker-no-effect.ts  # Should work now

# Test with full Effect scheduling
bun run test-simple-worker.ts  # Should work now

# Test actual services
bun run src/run.ts  # Should repeat every N seconds
```

---

## Testing & Verification

### Unit Test - Isolated Worker RPC

```typescript
// packages/j8s/examples/test-kkrpc-direct.ts
const worker = new Worker(url.href, { type: "module" })
const io = new WorkerParentIO(worker)
const rpc = new RPCChannel<{}, IService>(io, {})
const api = rpc.getAPI<IService>()

await api.start()       // ✅ Should complete
await api.healthCheck() // ✅ Should return health status
await api.stop()        // ✅ Should complete

io.destroy()
```

### Integration Test - WorkerService Without Effect

```typescript
// packages/j8s/examples/test-worker-no-effect.ts
const workerService = createWorkerService("test", url, { autoTerminate: false })

await workerService.start()       // ✅ Should complete (not hang)
const health = await workerService.healthCheck()  // ✅ Should work
await workerService.stop()        // ✅ Should complete
```

### Integration Test - Full Scheduled Job

```typescript
// packages/j8s/examples/test-simple-worker.ts
const serviceManager = new ServiceManager()
const workerService = createWorkerService("test", url, { autoTerminate: false })

serviceManager.addService(workerService, {
  scheduledJob: {
    schedule: Schedule.cron("*/10 * * * * *"), // Every 10 seconds
    timeout: Duration.millis(5000),
  },
})

await serviceManager.startServiceEffect("test")
// Wait and observe - should see repeated executions
```

**Expected output**:
```
🎯 [WORKER 50080] Worker cron job run #1 - START
✅ [WORKER 50080] Worker cron job run #1 - COMPLETED
Service 'test' completed successfully
... (10 seconds later) ...
🎯 [WORKER 50080] Worker cron job run #1 - START  // Note: Counter resets (new worker)
✅ [WORKER 50080] Worker cron job run #1 - COMPLETED
Service 'test' completed successfully
```

### Production Test

```bash
cd apps/services
bun run src/run.ts

# Should see services repeat:
# - income-history-snapshot: every 20 seconds
# - orders-history-snapshot: every 20 seconds  
# - wallet-balance-history: every 30 seconds
# - risk-control-cron: every 30 seconds
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Type Safety Gotcha

The `as any` type cast in WorkerService masked the incompatibility:

```typescript
this.io = new WorkerParentIO(this.worker as any);  // ⚠️ Hides type mismatch
```

**Lesson**: Avoid `as any` type casts. They hide bugs.

**Better approach**:
```typescript
// Let TypeScript catch the mismatch
this.io = new WorkerParentIO(this.worker);  // Type error if incompatible
```

### 2. Test Library Integration Directly

When a library (kkrpc) isn't working through your wrapper (j8s), always test the library directly first.

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Test kkrpc independently
const worker = new Worker(...)
const io = new WorkerParentIO(worker)
// ... direct kkrpc usage

// ❌ Bad: Only test through your wrapper
const service = createWorkerService(...)  // Might hide integration issues
```

### 3. Runtime Environment Matters

Node.js `worker_threads` vs Web Worker API:
- **Node.js**: Has its own threading model (`worker_threads`)
- **Bun/Deno**: Implement web standards (Web Worker API)
- **Libraries**: May target specific APIs

**Lesson**: Check library documentation for runtime requirements.

### 4. Logging Strategy

Progressive logging levels helped narrow down the issue:

1. **Application level**: "Service completed"
2. **Framework level**: "ServiceManager starting service"
3. **Adapter level**: "IServiceAdapter.start() called"
4. **Worker level**: "WorkerService.initWorker()"
5. **Worker thread level**: "Worker start() returning"

Each level revealed where the flow stopped.

### 5. Effect Integration Pattern

When integrating Effect with promise-based APIs:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Let promises resolve naturally
const serviceEffect = Effect.tryPromise({
  try: () => managedService.adapter.start(),  // Promise-based
  catch: (e) => (e instanceof Error ? e : new Error(String(e))),
});

// Use Effect.race for timeout, not Effect.timeout
const timedEffect = Effect.race(
  serviceEffect,
  Effect.sleep(timeout).pipe(Effect.andThen(Effect.fail(error)))
);
```

### 6. State Management in Adapters

For services that run repeatedly:
1. Track state (`started`, `startPromise`)
2. Reset state after each run
3. Prevent concurrent starts

```typescript
// Reset state after each scheduled run
yield* Effect.promise(() => managedService.adapter.stop());
```

---

## Additional Notes

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. **Worked Before Effect**: The bug was latent but different execution paths may have hidden it
2. **Bun-Specific**: Only manifests in Bun (which uses web Worker API)
3. **Type Cast**: `as any` suppressed TypeScript errors
4. **Integration Complexity**: Multi-layer architecture (Effect → ServiceManager → IServiceAdapter → WorkerService → kkrpc) made debugging harder

### Future Improvements

1. **Add Type Tests**: Ensure Worker type compatibility
   ```typescript
   type WorkerCompatibility = Worker extends Parameters<typeof WorkerParentIO>[0] ? true : false;
   const test: WorkerCompatibility = true; // Compile-time check
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: Test kkrpc integration independently from scheduling

3. **Documentation**: Document kkrpc's web Worker requirement

4. **Runtime Detection**: Detect and warn if using wrong Worker API
   ```typescript
   if ('threadId' in worker) {
     console.warn('Using node:worker_threads instead of Web Worker API');
   }
   ```

**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Time to Debug**: ~3 hours  
**Severity**: Critical (blocking all scheduled jobs)  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved and Verified

---

## Verification Results

**Test Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Test Duration**: 120 seconds (2 minutes)  
**Test Command**: `bun run src/run.ts`

### Observed Behavior

All cron jobs executed repeatedly at their configured intervals:

| Service | Config | Expected | Observed Execution Times | Status |
|---------|--------|----------|--------------------------|--------|
| income-history-snapshot | `*/20 * * * * *` | Every 20s | 01:44:15, 01:44:20, 01:44:40, 01:45:00, 01:45:20 | ✅ |
| orders-history-snapshot | `*/20 * * * * *` | Every 20s | 01:44:15, 01:44:20, 01:44:40, 01:45:00, 01:45:20 | ✅ |
| wallet-balance-history | `*/30 * * * * *` | Every 30s | 01:44:15, 01:44:30, 01:45:00 | ✅ |
| risk-control-cron | `*/30 * * * * *` | Every 30s | 01:44:15, 01:44:30, 01:45:00 | ✅ |

### Key Success Metrics

- ✅ **No TimeoutException errors** - Services complete within expected timeframes
- ✅ **Repeated execution** - Jobs run multiple times without hanging
- ✅ **Correct intervals** - Timing matches cron expressions exactly
- ✅ **RPC communication** - Worker threads communicate successfully with main thread
- ✅ **Resource cleanup** - Database connections maintained across runs
- ✅ **State management** - `IServiceAdapter` state resets correctly between runs

### Conclusion

The fix successfully resolved all identified issues. The j8s framework now correctly:
1. Uses web Worker API for Bun compatibility
2. Manages worker thread lifecycles for scheduled jobs
3. Resets service adapter state between scheduled runs
4. Prevents duplicate service starts
5. Uses `Effect.repeat` for continuous job execution

**Production Ready**: ✅ Yes
