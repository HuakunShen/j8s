## Core Issue: Worker Service Scheduled Jobs Not Repeating

**Date**: October 5-6, 2025  
**Component**: j8s framework (WorkerService + Effect scheduling)  
**Severity**: Critical - Blocking all scheduled cron jobs  
**Resolution Time**: ~4 hours (debugging + systematic testing)

---

## Problem Statement

After migrating j8s to use the Effect library for scheduling, worker services configured with `scheduledJob` were only executing once and then never repeating, despite being configured for frequent intervals (e.g., every 20-30 seconds).

### Symptoms Observed

1. Services started successfully on first run
2. Services completed their tasks successfully
3. **No subsequent executions** - services never repeated according to schedule
4. No error messages or crashes - system appeared "healthy" but inactive

### User Impact

- All production cron jobs non-functional:
  - `income-history-snapshot` (every 20s)
  - `orders-history-snapshot` (every 20s)
  - `wallet-balance-history` (every 30s)
  - `risk-control-cron` (every 30s)

---

## Initial Hypothesis & Investigation

### Hypothesis 1: Effect Scheduling Issue
**Theory**: `Effect.schedule` or `Effect.repeat` not working correctly with worker services.

**Testing Approach**: Created isolated test with `BaseService` (non-worker) to verify Effect scheduling works independently.

**Result**: ❌ Effect scheduling works fine with `BaseService`. Problem is specific to `WorkerService`.

### Hypothesis 2: Worker Thread Communication (RPC)
**Theory**: RPC communication via `kkrpc` failing or hanging after first call.

**Testing Approach**: 
1. Created minimal test bypassing Effect to isolate RPC layer
2. Tested `kkrpc` directly without j8s wrapper
3. Compared working kkrpc tests vs j8s implementation

**Result**: ✅ Found the issue! `kkrpc` works perfectly when used directly, but hangs when used through j8s's `WorkerService`.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Root Cause #1: Incorrect Worker API (CRITICAL)

**What Was Wrong**:
```typescript
// j8s was using Node.js worker_threads API
import { Worker as NodeWorker } from "node:worker_threads";
this.worker = new NodeWorker(url, options);
this.worker.addListener("error", ...);  // Node.js API
```

**Why It Failed**:
- `kkrpc` is designed for the **web Worker API** (standardized across browsers, Deno, Bun)
- Node.js `worker_threads` has different API surface:
  - Different event handling (`.addListener()` vs `.addEventListener()`)
  - Different message serialization behavior
  - Different worker lifecycle management
- Bun provides the global `Worker` API that follows web standards
- The type cast `as any` was hiding the incompatibility

**Impact**: RPC calls would complete once but subsequent calls would hang, preventing scheduled repetition.

### Root Cause #2: Adapter State Management (CRITICAL)

**What Was Wrong**:
The `IServiceAdapter` tracks a `started` flag to prevent concurrent starts:

```typescript
async start(): Promise<void> {
  if (this.started || this.startPromise) {
    return this.startPromise || Promise.resolve(); // Returns early!
  }
  // ... actual start logic
  this.started = true;  // Flag set, never reset
}
```

**Why It Failed**:
- First scheduled run: `started = false` → Executes successfully → `started = true`
- Second scheduled run: `started = true` → Returns immediately without executing
- No mechanism to reset state for repeated scheduled jobs

**Impact**: After first execution, all subsequent scheduler attempts returned early without running the service.

---

## Solution: Minimal Fix

After systematic testing (reverting changes one by one), we identified the **minimal necessary fix**:

### Fix #1: Switch to Web Worker API ✅

**File**: `packages/j8s/src/WorkerService.ts`

```typescript
// Use the global Worker API (web workers) instead of node:worker_threads
// kkrpc expects the web Worker API which is available in Bun/Deno/browsers
// @ts-ignore - Worker is a global in Bun
type WorkerType = Worker;

// In initWorker():
this.worker = new Worker(workerPath, workerOptions);
this.io = new WorkerParentIO(this.worker);
this.worker.addEventListener("error", ...);  // Web API
this.worker.addEventListener("messageerror", ...);  // Web API
```

**Lines Changed**: ~10 lines  
**Impact**: Ensures kkrpc can communicate properly with workers

### Fix #2: Reset Adapter State After Each Run ✅

**File**: `packages/j8s/src/ServiceManager.ts`

```typescript
// In setupScheduledJob(), after service execution:
const result = yield* Effect.either(timedServiceEffect);

// Reset adapter state after each scheduled run to allow next execution
// This is critical for scheduled jobs that need to run repeatedly
yield* Effect.promise(() => managedService.adapter.stop());
```

**Lines Changed**: ~3 lines  
**Impact**: Allows adapter to accept subsequent start() calls for repeated execution

## Options Considered & Rejected

During debugging, several "fixes" were attempted but later proven unnecessary through systematic testing:

### Option 1: `autoTerminate: false` ❌ NOT NEEDED

**What**: Change all worker services from `autoTerminate: true` to `autoTerminate: false`

**Rationale**: Thought workers were terminating too early, preventing RPC responses.

**Testing**: Reverted to `autoTerminate: true` → **Services still work!**

**Decision**: Keep original `autoTerminate: true` setting. With proper Worker API, this isn't needed.

### Option 2: Keep-Alive Interval ❌ NOT NEEDED

**What**: Add `setInterval()` in `expose.ts` to keep worker event loop active

```typescript
const keepAlive = setInterval(() => {}, 1000000);
```

**Rationale**: Thought Bun was terminating workers prematurely.

**Testing**: Removed keep-alive → **Services still work!**

**Decision**: Remove the keep-alive code. Web Worker API handles this properly.

### Option 3: Filter Scheduled Services from Manual Start ❌ NOT NEEDED

**What**: Prevent `startAllServicesEffect()` from manually starting services that have `scheduledJob` config

**Rationale**: Thought duplicate start calls were causing race conditions.

**Testing**: Removed filtering → **Services still work!**

**Decision**: Simplify code. The adapter's idempotent start logic already handles this safely.

## Systematic Testing Methodology

To identify the minimal fix, each change was reverted individually and tested:

| # | Change | Test Result | Conclusion |
|---|--------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Revert `autoTerminate: false` → `true` | ✅ PASS | Not needed |
| 2 | Remove keep-alive interval | ✅ PASS | Not needed |
| 3 | Remove `adapter.stop()` reset | ❌ FAIL | **REQUIRED** |
| 4 | Remove scheduled service filtering | ✅ PASS | Not needed |
| 5 | Revert to Node.js worker_threads | ❌ FAIL | **REQUIRED** |

**Test Criteria**: Services must execute multiple times at correct intervals over 60+ seconds.

**Result**: Only 2 changes are necessary (13 lines of code total).

---

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Use Web Worker API Instead of Node.js worker_threads

**Why**: 
- j8s aims to be runtime-agnostic (Bun, Deno, Node.js)
- `kkrpc` is designed for web Worker API (standardized)
- Bun provides global `Worker` following web standards
- More portable and future-proof

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pro: Works with Bun, Deno, browsers
- ✅ Pro: Aligns with kkrpc's expectations
- ⚠️ Con: May need polyfill for Node.js (if we support it)
- ⚠️ Con: Using `@ts-ignore` to bypass TypeScript (needs better type solution)

**Future Consideration**: Add proper TypeScript types for Worker or create runtime detection.

### Decision 2: Reset Adapter State via stop()

**Why**:
- Adapter's `started` flag prevents concurrent starts (good for one-time services)
- Scheduled jobs need to run repeatedly → must reset state
- Calling `stop()` is the existing mechanism to reset this state

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pro: Uses existing API, no new methods needed
- ✅ Pro: Ensures resources are cleaned up between runs
- ⚠️ Con: Semantically weird - calling "stop" just to reset state
- ⚠️ Con: May have side effects if services expect stop() only on shutdown

**Future Consideration**: Add explicit `reset()` method to `IServiceAdapter` for better semantics.

### Decision 3: Keep Code Minimal (Revert Unnecessary Changes)

**Why**:
- Simpler code is easier to maintain and understand
- Unnecessary defensive code adds cognitive load
- "Minimal fix" principle - change only what's broken

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pro: Less code to maintain
- ✅ Pro: Clearer what the actual fix is
- ✅ Pro: Easier for future developers to understand
- ⚠️ Con: Less "defensive" against edge cases (but no edge cases identified)

## Future Considerations

### Immediate (Next Sprint)

1. **Better TypeScript Types for Worker**
   - Remove `@ts-ignore` hack
   - Create proper type definitions that work across runtimes
   - Consider conditional types based on runtime detection

2. **Explicit Adapter Reset Method**
   ```typescript
   interface IServiceAdapter {
     reset(): Promise<void>;  // Clear state without full stop
   }
   ```
   - Better semantics than calling `stop()` just to reset
   - Allows keeping resources alive if needed

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document Worker API requirements in j8s README
   - Add JSDoc comments explaining scheduled job state management
   - Create example showing proper scheduled worker service

### Long-term (Future)

1. **Runtime Detection & Polyfills**
   - Detect if running in Node.js vs Bun vs Deno
   - Provide polyfills for missing APIs
   - Ensure j8s works across all target runtimes

2. **Better Service Lifecycle Hooks**
   - Consider `beforeRepeat()` / `afterRepeat()` hooks for scheduled jobs
   - Allow services to maintain state across repeated executions
   - Provide explicit control over resource lifecycle

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better error messages when Worker API is unavailable
   - Detect kkrpc communication failures early
   - Provide fallback or clearer errors for debugging

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Library Integration Matters**: When using a library (kkrpc), verify you're using the correct API that the library expects. Type casts (`as any`) can hide incompatibilities.

2. **Test Incrementally**: Systematic testing (reverting changes one at a time) revealed that only 2 of 5 changes were actually necessary. This prevented unnecessary code complexity.

3. **Runtime Differences Matter**: Node.js vs Bun vs Deno have different APIs even for "standard" features like Workers. Design for portability from the start.

4. **State Management in Repeated Execution**: Services designed for one-time execution (with state guards) need explicit reset logic when used in repeated/scheduled contexts.

### Process Lessons

1. **Isolate Variables**: By creating minimal tests (BaseService test, direct kkrpc test, WorkerService test), we could isolate the problem layer by layer.

2. **Verify Assumptions**: The initial fix "worked" but included unnecessary changes. Systematic testing revealed the minimal fix.

3. **Documentation While Fresh**: Creating detailed documentation (MINIMAL-FIX-SUMMARY.md) immediately after debugging captures valuable context that would be lost later.
