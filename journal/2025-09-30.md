## 2025-09-30: Fixing Concurrent Service Startup with Proper Error Handling

### Context

A test failure was discovered in the `j8s` package where the `startAllServicesEffect` method was not properly handling errors when starting multiple services concurrently. The issue was introduced in a recent commit that attempted to fix a problem where only the first account listener service was starting instead of all six.

### Problem Analysis

The original implementation used `Effect.all` without concurrency options, which started services sequentially. A commit attempted to fix this by using `Effect.fork` to start services in separate fibers, but this isolated errors in their own fibers, causing the API to always return a 200 status even when services failed to start.

### Options Considered

1. **Revert to sequential startup**: This would fix error handling but break concurrent startup needed for account listeners
2. **Use Effect.fork with manual error tracking**: Complex implementation with potential for race conditions
3. **Use Effect.all with concurrency option**: The chosen solution - maintains both concurrency and error handling

### Final Decision & Rationale

The chosen solution uses `Effect.all` with the `concurrency: 'unbounded'` option, which:
- Starts all services concurrently without waiting for each other
- Properly propagates errors to the main effect
- Tracks which services succeeded and which failed
- Provides detailed error messages

### Key Changes Made

1. **Modified `startAllServicesEffect` in ServiceManager.ts**:
   - Replaced `Effect.fork` approach with `Effect.all` with `concurrency: 'unbounded'`
   - Added comprehensive error tracking with success/failure status for each service
   - Implemented detailed logging at each step of the process

2. **Added Detailed Logging**:
   - Initial log reporting total number of services
   - Success log for each service that starts
   - Error log for each service that fails
   - Summary log with counts of successful/failed services
   - Detailed error message when any services fail

### Future Considerations

The solution provides a good balance between performance (concurrent startup) and reliability (proper error handling). The detailed logging will help with debugging and monitoring in production environments. This approach can be applied to other similar operations in the codebase that need both concurrency and proper error handling.
